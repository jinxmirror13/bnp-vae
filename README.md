### Purpose of this Repository

Provided a more detailed commentary on the code based on what is in the paper and for those, like myself, interested in learning how to program this sort of model (from a novice standpoint).

### Code

Using a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) prior, develop a hierarchical structure to cluster latent representations in a meaningful way within a VAE. Uses the nested Chinese Restaurant Process (nCRP) the BNP prior...
